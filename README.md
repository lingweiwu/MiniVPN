# MiniVPN
This is the Final Project of CIS 644 Internet Security, Syracuse University 2016 Spring, instructed by Wenliang Du.
Here is the lab page in SEED lab: http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_12.04/Networking/VPN/

This project designed and implement a simple SSL VPN for Ubuntu. The goal is to exemplify a number of security principles and technologies in class topics, including crypto, intergrity, authentication, key management, key exchange, and Public Key Infrastructure(PKI). I used OpenSSL package in this lab.
